# SpellChecker
The program takes a txt file as a dictionary (any languages wrote with UTF-8 symbol) and it determines the alphabet with it.
Then, it takes a txt file as an input, spellcheck the sentences and suggest correction for word not in the dictionnary.
It uses a hash table with a polynomial accumulation hash function written with Horner's rule.
